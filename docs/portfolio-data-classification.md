# Portfolio Data Classification

This classification governs every portfolio projection and is enforced by the
snapshot builders, token-scoped database functions, RLS, and Storage policies.

| Class | Examples | Personal public link | Broker Standard | Complete / approved viewer | Owner |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Public presentation | Published display name, age, selected biography, rashi, selected career/education/lifestyle fields, theme | Sanitized snapshot only | Yes when allowlisted | Yes | Yes |
| Public media | A primary or gallery photo explicitly set to Visible to all | Temporary URL | Temporary URL from pinned manifest | Temporary URL | Yes |
| Protected preview | Generated low-detail derivative for blurred or approval-only photos | Preview only | Pinned eligible media | Original temporary URL | Yes |
| Restricted identity | Exact birth time, precise birth/location references, detailed verification data | No | No for exact birth time/internal references | Only when explicitly part of Complete | Yes |
| Restricted family | Family-member names, occupations, locations, family notes | Bounded by personal projection | Allowlisted non-contact family presentation | Yes when included in Complete | Yes |
| Restricted contact | Contact names, phone numbers and email addresses | No | No | Yes after identity-bound approval | Yes |
| Owner-only contact notes | Secure contact notes and internal context | No | No | No | Yes |
| Restricted financial/internal | Income, wealth stage, credit data, private preference or package answers, attribution metadata | No | No | No unless a later explicit contract says otherwise | Yes |
| Private storage metadata | Original protected paths, thumbnails, database UUIDs, horoscope paths | No | Never raw; only short-lived authorized delivery | Minimum authorized delivery only | Yes |

## Disclosure Rules

1. Publishing is explicit and the dashboard preview renders the exact sanitized
   payload before it is copied into `public_portfolio_snapshots`.
2. A public URL resolves one exact active token through
   `resolve_public_portfolio`; callers cannot select or list snapshot rows.
3. Restricted values are omitted, not visually hidden. The public snapshot
   never stores contact data, private media paths, signed URLs, database IDs, or
   horoscope descriptors.
4. Approved data uses a separate snapshot and a separate authenticated resolver.
   Access requires an active, identity-bound full grant on every request.
5. Signed media URLs are short-lived. A private-mode gallery exposes only its
   first public gallery original; every later item uses a generated derivative.
6. Missing, malformed, expired, rotated, and unpublished links all resolve to
   the same unavailable result.
7. Broker Standard is a generated allowlist projection stored on an immutable
   disclosure version. It cannot contain Protected Contact, financial/private
   package data, exact birth time, raw storage paths, or internal identifiers.
8. A broker Introduction URL grants no disclosure by possession. Only either
   stored participant's current authenticated owner may resolve the other
   participant's pinned Broker Standard Profile.

## Complete Portfolio Lifecycle

1. A viewer must sign in before submitting an access request. Requests are
   permanently bound to that verified Supabase user ID.
2. Owners may approve or reject a new request. A rejected request must be
   explicitly reopened before it can be approved later.
3. Complete Portfolio grants expire after 15 days. Owners can renew an active or expired
   grant for another 15 days, or revoke it immediately.
4. Rotating a link or unpublishing a portfolio revokes every active grant and
   closes its approved requests. Republishing requires a fresh request and
   approval; ordinary published-data updates preserve still-valid grants.
5. Portfolio expiry blocks public and approved access. Renewing the portfolio
   link restores access only for grants that are themselves still active.
6. The Complete Portfolio includes the approved identity, astrology, family, education,
   career, lifestyle, preference, photo-original, and horoscope projections.
   Approved contact details are included. Secure notes, credit/internal values,
   and private preference notes remain owner-only.
7. Grant creation, renewal, use, rejection, revocation, expiry, rotation, and
   unpublish events are immutable and contain no request message, contact data,
   share token, signed URL, or storage path.
