# BrokerDesk Phase 2 — Implementation Progress

Status: Historical implementation log; merged implementation now continues
through NAK-76 Broker Standard, NAK-77 customer broker-consent controls, and
NAK-78 bilateral authenticated Introduction access.
Started: 2026-09-08  
Approved plan: [Phase 1 Implementation Plan](./phase-1-implementation-plan.md)

## Tracking approach

For the current product contract and next work, use
[`docs/vivintrodesk-mvp-contract.md`](../../docs/vivintrodesk-mvp-contract.md).
Branch names and “current” status below describe their point in history and are
not the present repository state.

The user has opted out of Linear updates for this work. Decisions, changed files, verification results, risks, and deviations are recorded here, in the master plan, and in associated GitHub pull requests. The safety foundation merged through PR #40, the capability foundation through PR #41, private onboarding through PR #42, and the secure team-access foundation through PR #43. Related implementation units remain on one feature branch with local checkpoint commits; a pull request and merge happen only at a deliberate, reviewable checkpoint instead of after every small phase.

## Repository preparation

- Original checkout: reconciled with the latest remote state; obsolete landing-page edits and duplicate authentication CSS were intentionally excluded.
- Integration branch: `security/nak-68-brokerdesk-safety-foundation`.
- Pull request: [#40 — BrokerDesk safety foundation](https://github.com/NagarjunMa/Nakshatra/pull/40).
- Merge: squash commit `22faf86` on `main` after all required checks passed.
- Completed branch and isolated phase worktree: removed after clean-state, tree-equivalence, and patch-equivalence verification.
- Capability pull request: [#41 — BrokerDesk capability foundation](https://github.com/NagarjunMa/Nakshatra/pull/41), squash-merged as `32e5b62`.
- Onboarding pull request: [#42 — Private BrokerDesk onboarding](https://github.com/NagarjunMa/Nakshatra/pull/42), squash-merged as `44b5641` after all three required checks passed.
- Team-access pull request: [#43 — Secure BrokerDesk team access foundation](https://github.com/NagarjunMa/Nakshatra/pull/43), squash-merged as `c75f6f1` after all required application, secret-scan, clean-migration, and pgTAP checks passed.
- Representative-verification checkpoint: local commit `e85bd19` on `feat/nak-68-broker-representative-verification`; intentionally not pushed or merged yet.
- Current branch: `feat/nak-68-brokerdesk-customer-intake`, stacked from `e85bd19` so the related units can be reviewed together at the next deliberate PR checkpoint.

## Slice 1 changes implemented

### Dependency security

- Next.js and matching ESLint config updated from `16.3.1` to `16.3.4`.
- Sharp updated from `0.35.3` to `0.35.4`.
- Vitest and its coverage provider updated from `4.1.10` to `4.1.11`.
- Transitive `js-yaml` resolved to its patched version through the lockfile.
- No unrelated major-version upgrades were taken.

### Customer ownership boundary

- Added `20260908000000_separate_candidate_ownership_from_agency_access.sql`.
- `owns_candidate` now requires the authenticated user to be `primary_owner_user_id`.
- `created_by` and `current_organization_id` are audit/legacy attribution only and confer no ownership.
- `can_manage_portfolio` no longer grants management through organization membership or `owner_organization_id`.
- The live-session requirement remains inside both security-definer predicates.
- Direct organization-operator policies were removed from customer candidate and portfolio tables.
- Future broker access will use narrow consent-, capability-, assignment-, and mandate-aware projections.

### Private defaults and opaque references

- Future `app_private` tables, sequences, and functions receive fail-closed default privileges.
- Added a private public-reference generator using 128 bits of database randomness.
- Allowed reference types are workspace `wrk_`, broker/customer relationship `bcr_`, broker route `bir_`, customer Introduction case `inc_`, task `tsk_`, import `imp_`, and invitation `inv_`.
- Added strict application schemas that prevent reference types from being substituted.
- Branded the application reference types so accidental cross-type use is also rejected by TypeScript.

### Rate-limit identity hardening

- Replaced the unkeyed deterministic IP/user-agent digest with HMAC-SHA-256 using a dedicated server-only secret.
- Production forwarding headers are ignored unless the deployment is verified as Vercel or explicitly configured behind Cloudflare.
- Invalid network hints normalize to a neutral value instead of being persisted or trusted.
- User-agent input is bounded before hashing.
- Production fails closed with a `503` when the HMAC key is unavailable.
- Added tests for keyed rotation, spoofed forwarding headers, stable 64-character database input, and missing-key failure.
- Added trusted Vercel and explicitly configured Cloudflare address normalization coverage, including bracketed IPv6 input.

### Multi-agency tests

- Added `brokerdesk_ownership_boundary.test.sql` with Customer A, Customer B, Broker A, Broker B, and a suspended employee.
- Both customers are represented in both agency relationship tables.
- Each broker sees only its own agency relationships.
- Neither broker directly reads or mutates customer candidate or portfolio rows.
- Updated the former RBAC expectation that incorrectly required a broker-agent candidate mutation to persist.

## Database verification outcome

Docker and Podman remain unavailable on the local host, so executable database validation ran in PR CI. CI replayed all migrations from a clean database and ran the full pgTAP suite successfully. The first run correctly exposed two fixture-contract mismatches; both were fixed before merge, and the rerun passed all required checks.

## Ownership-predicate impact review

All current callers of `owns_candidate` and `can_manage_portfolio` were reviewed after changing them to customer-owner-only predicates. Their surviving uses protect customer-controlled publication, media, horoscope, snapshot, reveal-grant, interest-decision, verification, and dashboard-draft operations. None requires implicit agency ownership. BrokerDesk access will therefore be added as explicit, narrower projections and commands instead of widening these predicates again.

## Next executable steps

1. Run the representative-verification and customer-intake migrations plus their pgTAP suites through clean PR CI; Docker/Podman remains unavailable locally.
2. Continue Slice 3 with assignment commands, renewal controls, and cursor pagination over the safe customer projection.
3. Keep staged CSV contents unavailable until legal retention and production KMS ownership are approved; manual hashed-email invitations are the safe current intake path.
4. Design business-contact verification without allowing a verified representative alone to activate BrokerDesk.
5. Keep business-document upload and organization activation unavailable until retention, KMS, malware scanning, and reviewer authorization are implemented and approved.

## Slice 2 completion decisions

- A broker representative must not be represented by a synthetic `candidate`. Candidate identity remains customer/portfolio identity.
- Representative verification must reuse the existing Didit provider lifecycle, webhook handling, retry controls, and audit model through an explicit verification-subject abstraction.
- Account-deletion reauthentication remains deletion-only. BrokerDesk privilege changes require a separate purpose-bound proof tied to the actor, fresh Supabase session, workspace, action, expiry, and one-time consumption.
- Team invitation, access replacement, suspension, verification management, export, and future billing/recovery actions cannot share an unscoped bearer proof.
- BrokerDesk team commands must re-evaluate live membership, role capability, workspace state, and target restrictions inside the same database transaction that consumes the proof.
- Browser onboarding end-to-end coverage is already present and passed 20 desktop/mobile checks in PR #42; it is not an outstanding Slice 2 task.

## Privileged fresh-authentication foundation implemented

- Added an independent private challenge store for BrokerDesk privilege changes; it does not broaden or reuse the account-deletion challenge table.
- Bound every challenge and proof to the authenticated actor, opaque workspace reference, exact allowlisted action, initiating session, newer verified session, ten-minute expiry, and one-time consumption.
- Added database authorization mapping for `team_invite`, `team_access_replace`, `team_suspend`, and `verification_manage`; only active owner/admin member-access presets with the corresponding capability may start or complete a challenge.
- Kept proof consumption private and ungranted. A later audited command must call it with its internally resolved organization and exact action inside the command transaction.
- Added an independent rate-limit bucket and independent server-only HMAC secret. Raw proofs are never stored; only SHA-256 hashes reach the private database table.
- Added the versioned reauthentication-start endpoint with same-origin enforcement, bounded/strict JSON, live-session validation, verified-account email derivation, safe OAuth/OTP callback, uniform inaccessible-workspace handling, and no caller-selected identity.
- Scoped the HttpOnly proof cookie to the exact workspace API path and signed its workspace/action payload. Changing a URL cannot change the signed scope or database authorization.
- Hardened the shared authentication callback so reserved reauthentication callbacks require their matching signed transaction; a stale deletion cookie can no longer turn an ordinary sign-in callback into deletion reauthentication.
- Added application and adversarial pgTAP coverage for cross-workspace actors, same-session rejection, action substitution, replay, and immediate membership suspension.
- This is a fresh-authentication prerequisite, not the complete MFA release gate. No privileged team or verification mutation is exposed yet; owner/admin MFA enrollment and assurance-level enforcement remain required before those commands become active.

## Merged verification for the Slice 2 team-access checkpoint

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Static database fixture contract | Passed |
| ESLint | Passed with the existing Open Graph `<img>` warning only |
| TypeScript | Passed |
| Full application suite | Passed: 91 files, 523 tests |
| Feature coverage policy | Passed: 40 mapper, service, and contract files at 80% or higher per metric |
| Production build | Passed; new versioned route included |
| Dependency audit | Passed: 0 known vulnerabilities |
| New executable pgTAP suites | Passed in PR #43 CI after clean migration replay, including fresh-auth/MFA, team projection, invitations, access replacement, and suspension |

## Opaque team projection implemented

- Added immutable server-generated `mbr_` references for organization members; internal membership, user, and organization UUIDs are omitted from the BrokerDesk team response.
- Disabled the legacy generic membership read/insert/update/delete RLS paths for matchmaker agencies while preserving the established family/platform organization behavior.
- Added an owner/admin-only database projection that works during onboarding, returns the same unavailable shape for malformed, missing, cross-agency, advisor, and unauthorized requests, and omits removed members.
- Limited the projection to the employee name, verified account email when present, safe role preset, membership status, simple customer-access label/count, joined time, and current-user flag.
- New employees remain at `none` customer access until explicit assignments exist; suspended employees remain visible to authorized owners/admins with a clear suspended status.
- Added a no-store, independently rate-limited versioned team-read endpoint and registered it in the machine-readable endpoint inventory.
- Added application tests plus an adversarial pgTAP suite covering reference generation/immutability, UUID omission, direct-table bypass attempts, cross-agency substitution, advisor enumeration, and suspended-member projection.

## BrokerDesk MFA assurance gate implemented

- Changed the privilege flow to two stages: a fresh conventional sign-in creates only signed, HttpOnly MFA-pending state; it can no longer issue a privileged action proof.
- Added a focused `/brokerdesk/security/mfa` experience using simple language and the existing Nakshatra visual system. Brokers may enroll a TOTP authenticator or verify an existing one; setup secrets remain browser-only.
- Added a same-origin, strict and bounded `POST /api/v1/brokerdesk/reauth/complete` endpoint with its own database rate-limit bucket. Its workspace, action, challenge, and next destination come only from signed or server-derived state.
- PostgreSQL now requires the live JWT to be `aal2` both when storing the hashed one-time proof and when a future command consumes it. A later downgrade to `aal1` blocks consumption even if the cookie is present.
- Missing or tampered pending state, cross-origin requests, action injection, and AAL1 completion fail closed. Privileged mutations remain unavailable until they atomically consume this proof and write their audit event.
- Enabled local Supabase TOTP enrollment and verification while leaving phone MFA disabled.

## BrokerDesk employee invitation and acceptance implemented

- Added an operational owner/admin team-settings page using the existing minimal team projection and simple role/customer-access language.
- Creating an invitation requires the exact `team_invite` AAL2 proof. PostgreSQL consumes the proof, rechecks actor and target-role restrictions, enforces idempotency and quotas, creates the private invitation, and writes its audit event in one transaction.
- Owners may invite Admin, Broker, Coordinator, or View-only employees; admins cannot create another admin; nobody can invite another owner or their own account.
- Invitation credentials use an independent server-only key so an identical idempotent retry recreates the same link without persisting plaintext. The private database stores only token and normalized-email hashes plus a masked email hint.
- Links use `/join/team#token=...`. Same-origin code removes the fragment from browser history and exchanges it into a signed, exact-path, 15-minute HttpOnly cookie. GET requests and link scanners cannot accept an invitation.
- Acceptance requires a live Nakshatra session with the same verified email, creates the employee in the existing membership/RBAC source of truth, and gives zero customer assignments by default.
- Tokens expire after seven days, work once, return neutral unavailable responses, and cannot reactivate an existing suspended or removed employee. Creation and acceptance are append-only audited.

## BrokerDesk role replacement and suspension implemented

- Added explicit versioned commands for role replacement and suspension. Both resolve `wrk_` and `mbr_` references inside PostgreSQL, require their exact action-scoped AAL2 proof, enforce current owner/admin authority, use idempotency keys, and append safe audit events atomically.
- Generic owner changes, self-demotion, self-suspension, and owner suspension are prohibited. Admins cannot modify or suspend another admin and cannot grant the admin preset.
- A role replacement updates the existing `organization_members` source of truth and its established access-preset trigger; it does not accept client-defined capabilities. Existing customer assignments remain but are usable only under the new role.
- Suspension changes only the target membership in the selected agency and invalidates that employee's pending privileged proofs for the agency. Effective BrokerDesk access stops immediately because every command rechecks active membership.
- The shared Nakshatra identity and Auth sessions are deliberately preserved: suspending an agency employee must not sign them out of their B2C customer profile or a different agency membership.
- Team settings now presents plain-language Change role and Suspend actions only for targets the current owner/admin may manage, explains the cross-surface identity boundary, and updates the visible row immediately after a successful command.

## Capability foundation implemented

- Added server-generated, immutable `wrk_` workspace and `bcr_` agency-relationship references. These are identifiers only and never capabilities.
- Added private owner/admin/advisor/coordinator/viewer presets backed by explicit capability and resource-scope records.
- Preserved the existing public membership enum as a compatibility input: `broker_agent` maps to advisor, `editor` to coordinator, and authorization evaluates capabilities rather than exposing the legacy role directly.
- Added private, cross-organization-safe member access, customer assignment, and customer mandate structures with current-time and revocation checks.
- Defined effective relationship authorization as live session × active agency/member × latest entitlement × capability × scope/assignment × current mandate.
- Made `brokerdesk.enabled` fail closed and latest-record-wins so a newer false or expired entitlement immediately removes access.
- Initially replaced broad `broker_clients` CRUD with capability-scoped reads; Slice 3 then closed direct reads entirely in favor of separate broker/customer projections. Relationship mutations remain reserved for audited command RPCs.
- Kept candidate and portfolio ownership owner-only; no new broker projection reads either table.
- Added a minimal server-only access resolver with the same `{ enabled: false }` contract for malformed, missing, disabled, suspended, and cross-tenant workspace references.
- Added a strict, machine-readable endpoint inventory for the first planned BrokerDesk and combined customer contracts.
- Added adversarial pgTAP coverage for two agencies, owners, assigned/unassigned advisors, a suspended employee, entitlement revocation, assignment revocation, mandate expiry/revocation, cross-tenant references, and deleted sessions.

## Broker representative identity verification implemented

- Generalized the private identity-verification subject from a candidate-only key to an explicit `candidate` or `organization_representative` domain while preserving candidate uniqueness and existing candidate-facing function signatures.
- Kept the representative bound to one organization and one authenticated user. No hidden customer, candidate, portfolio, or duplicate Didit workflow is created.
- Reused the existing consent, provider-session, webhook, lease, reconciliation, redaction, management-link, and audit lifecycle.
- Required the exact `verification_manage` proof from a live AAL2 session and consumed it atomically inside the owner-scoped start command. URL or workspace substitution cannot change that signed and database-resolved authority.
- Kept the raw representative birth date out of PostgreSQL, worker claims, audit events, and routine logs. The app sends it transiently to Didit; the database receives only a purpose-bound HMAC, and the digest is erased after a terminal decision.
- Added database binding triggers so legacy `candidate_id` compatibility columns cannot disagree with the neutral subject, attempt, management-token, or worker-lease relationship.
- A representative name change automatically revokes the prior subject result and management credential, returns the representative check to `required`, and appends a disabled BrokerDesk entitlement so a future active workspace fails closed.
- A verified representative advances only the representative verification check. The organization remains `onboarding`, `brokerdesk.enabled` remains false, and business registration/contact checks remain independent.
- Representative retries require another fresh security check and a newly entered birth date. The generic bearer management link cannot restart this business flow.
- The onboarding UI uses simple language, exposes no business-document upload, preserves the private consent-management link when Didit is temporarily unavailable, and never describes the representative as a matrimonial candidate.

## Slice 3 manual customer invitation and claim implemented

- Added a private `broker_client_intakes` boundary for manual invitations. It stores a normalized email hash, masked hint, hashed one-time capability, consent version, expiry, and lineage; it does not create a candidate, portfolio, or shareable customer record.
- Added routine owner/admin customer invitation creation with live-session, active-workspace, entitlement, capability, strict input, idempotency, 24-hour workspace quota, independent API rate limit, neutral cross-tenant errors, and append-only audit checks.
- Customer links use `/join/customer#token=...`. Same-origin code removes the fragment and exchanges it for a signed, exact-path, 30-minute HttpOnly cookie. The link works only for the matching verified account and only after explicit customer consent.
- A claimed invitation activates immediately when the account already owns a canonical B2C candidate. Otherwise it remains private and automatically activates only when the same account completes its one canonical portfolio; the broker sees only a safe “customer joined · portfolio not complete” action state.
- Activation creates or safely renews one `(organization, candidate)` relationship and a version-bound one-year matchmaking mandate. The customer portfolio remains the sole identity/content source; `portfolio.edit_as_delegate` is deliberately excluded from the default mandate.
- Added a composite organization/relationship foreign key and owner verification inside the activation transaction. A delayed activation rechecks current organization status and the latest BrokerDesk entitlement and fails closed after the consent term expires.
- Revoked authenticated `SELECT` on `broker_clients`. Internal candidate, organization, and relationship UUIDs can no longer be read through PostgREST; brokers and customers receive separate bounded security-definer projections over opaque references.
- Added `/brokerdesk/w/[workspaceRef]/customers`, `/join/customer`, and `/brokers` using the existing Nakshatra visual language. Brokers see only their agency's active relationships and pending actions; customers alone see all of their broker relationships together.
- Multiple agencies may independently invite and represent the same canonical customer. Broker A's projection contains no Broker B identity, count, status, or invitation lineage, while the customer projection correctly contains both relationships.
- Bulk CSV row storage remains closed. The unresolved retention and KMS decisions block production staged row data, but they do not block the minimal hashed-email manual invitation path.

## Slice 3 secure customer detail implemented

- Added the opaque `/brokerdesk/w/[workspaceRef]/customers/[relationshipRef]` page and matching versioned read API. Both workspace and relationship references are resolved together inside PostgreSQL; malformed, missing, cross-agency, unassigned, suspended, and expired-mandate access returns the same unavailable result.
- Added a bounded relationship-detail projection with no candidate, organization, membership, or relationship UUIDs. It returns only the agency relationship term, portfolio readiness, current assigned team, and server-calculated actions permitted by the caller's live role, assignment, mandate, entitlement, and session.
- Preserved publication privacy: broker list and detail identity fields come only from the last published portfolio snapshot. Before first publication, the broker sees a neutral `Customer` label; later draft edits cannot leak until the customer publishes them.
- Added immediate assignment-revocation and cross-workspace substitution coverage, plus page, route, contract, repository, service, and endpoint-inventory tests.

## Current customer-intake verification

## Progress log

### 2026-09-08

- Phase 1 implementation plan approved and Phase 2 authorized.
- Fetched latest remote `main` without changing the dirty original checkout.
- Created an isolated detached worktree at `c67337d`.
- Read the installed Next.js 16 guidance for route handlers, server/client boundaries, authentication, data security, and proxy behaviour.
- Established the latest-main lint, typecheck, unit-test, build, and dependency-security baseline.
- At the user's direction, stopped Linear operations and retained local documents as the implementation record.
- Applied patch-level dependency security updates and reduced the audit from six advisories to zero.
- Implemented the customer-ownership boundary, private default privileges, opaque public-reference contract, and two-agency ownership/isolation fixture.
- Hardened anonymous rate-limit subjects with a server-only keyed HMAC and trusted-proxy rules.
- Reviewed every current ownership-predicate caller and confirmed it belongs to a customer-controlled operation; no implicit agency ownership is required.
- Confirmed lint (one pre-existing warning), TypeScript, all 421 tests, the per-feature coverage policy, production build, static database checks, and a zero-vulnerability audit.
- Recorded the unavailable Docker/Podman runtime as an explicit database-verification gap.
- Reconciled all intended Slice 1 work onto `security/nak-68-brokerdesk-safety-foundation`; excluded obsolete UI changes and duplicate CSS that would have regressed the current B2C implementation.
- Opened PR #40 with reconciliation, security, and verification notes.
- Corrected the CI-discovered inactive-member fixture and stale approved-contact lifecycle assertion.
- Confirmed all three required checks, including clean migration replay and the full pgTAP suite.
- Squash-merged PR #40 as `22faf86`, synchronized local `main`, and removed the completed phase branch and isolated worktree after equivalence checks.
- Created `feat/nak-68-brokerdesk-capability-foundation` from the clean merged `main` for the next executable slice.

### 2026-09-09

- Confirmed local and remote `main` are identical at `22faf86` and the feature branch begins from that exact baseline.
- Implemented the BrokerDesk capability, scope, assignment, mandate, entitlement, and opaque workspace/relationship reference foundation.
- Tightened agency relationship reads and removed direct relationship mutations from the authenticated Data API surface.
- Added the server-only access contract/repository/service and the versioned endpoint inventory.
- Added two-agency authorization and immediate-revocation database tests; updated the earlier ownership fixture to explicitly enable BrokerDesk.
- Passed static database checks, TypeScript, all 430 tests, feature coverage, and lint with only the pre-existing Open Graph warning.
- Confirmed PR #41 passed application and database checks, squash-merged it as `32e5b62`, and synchronized `main` before creating `feat/nak-68-brokerdesk-onboarding-rbac`.
- Added private organization onboarding state, business and representative data, exact verification checks, quarantined document metadata, idempotency records, and append-only audit events.
- Added atomic workspace creation and versioned onboarding-save RPCs. Workspaces start as `onboarding` with `brokerdesk.enabled = false`; form submission cannot activate or verify them.
- Added same-shape unavailable handling for malformed, missing, and cross-tenant workspace references and closed direct legacy organization/matchmaker mutation grants.
- Added separate bootstrap/create/read/write rate limits and strict application/database input allowlists that reject organization IDs, roles, entitlements, and verification state from clients.
- Reused the B2C authentication UI with server-derived BrokerDesk continuation. BrokerDesk signup, password sign-in, OTP verification, and OAuth callback do not implicitly provision customer portfolios.
- Added the responsive `/brokerdesk/onboarding` flow for business, representative, practice, review, and verification stages. Document upload is visibly unavailable until secure release controls are complete.
- Added service, route, client API, auth-continuation, UI interaction, and 43-assertion pgTAP coverage. TypeScript, lint, production build, dependency audit, all 457 application tests with feature coverage, 20 desktop/mobile end-to-end checks, and the static database check pass.
- Docker/Podman is still unavailable locally. The new migration and pgTAP suite therefore require clean CI database replay before merge.
- Confirmed PR #42 passed lint/test/build, secret scan, and clean Supabase migration/pgTAP checks, then squash-merged it as `44b5641`.
- Synchronized local `main` with `origin/main` at `ac5026a` and created `feat/nak-68-brokerdesk-slice-2-completion` from that exact clean baseline.
- Adopted combined-checkpoint delivery: related Slice 2 completion units and, when review size remains reasonable, the first Slice 3 foundation may accumulate as local commits before one PR.
- Confirmed the existing Didit persistence is candidate-keyed and therefore cannot safely represent a broker without violating the one-customer-portfolio source of truth.
- Chose a separate purpose-bound BrokerDesk fresh-authentication proof as the first completion prerequisite; the existing account-deletion proof will not be broadened or reused.
- Implemented the purpose-bound fresh-auth perimeter across private database state, server-only repository/service/cookies, the versioned start route, callback completion, rate limiting, endpoint inventory, environment contract, and adversarial tests.
- Passed static database validation, lint, TypeScript, all 482 application tests with feature coverage, production build, and a zero-vulnerability dependency audit.
- Kept privileged mutations disabled and recorded MFA assurance plus clean executable database replay as release gates rather than presenting fresh login as sufficient authorization.
- Added opaque employee references and the first minimal BrokerDesk team-read projection; closed the broad legacy membership Data API surface for matchmaker agencies without altering family/platform organization behavior.
- Passed all 489 application tests and feature coverage, lint, TypeScript, production build, static database validation, and dependency audit after the team projection unit.
- Implemented the TOTP MFA assurance gate: first-factor callbacks now issue only signed pending state, the browser raises the live session to AAL2, and PostgreSQL requires AAL2 again at proof issuance and consumption.
- Added the strict MFA completion API, independent rate limit, server-derived continuation, no-index setup/verification UI, and adversarial application/database tests. All 498 application tests and feature coverage, lint, TypeScript, production build, static database validation, and dependency audit pass; the expanded 44-assertion pgTAP set awaits combined-checkpoint CI replay.
- Added the audited employee-invitation command, fragment-to-HttpOnly exchange, verified-email acceptance, team-settings UI, independent quotas, private hashed persistence, and existing-RBAC membership activation with no customer assignments.
- Verified invitation idempotency without authorization bypass, action-proof consumption, cross-account denial, single use, URL/history safety, owner exclusion, suspension preservation, cross-origin denial, authentication and rate-limit enforcement, fail-closed behavior, and safe projections. All 514 application tests and the feature-coverage gate pass; 26 new pgTAP assertions await the combined-checkpoint CI replay.

### 2026-09-10

- Added purpose-bound, audited role-replacement and immediate-suspension commands with opaque member routing, live AAL2 enforcement, current-authority checks, independent rate limits, and idempotent network retry behavior.
- Preserved shared Auth sessions during agency suspension so B2C and other-agency access are not collateral damage; invalidated only pending privileged proofs in the suspended agency.
- Added operational team controls and adversarial application/pgTAP coverage for cross-purpose proof use, caller-expanded payloads, owner/self/admin restrictions, role synchronization, audit, proof replay, immediate suspension, and shared-identity preservation.
- Passed all 523 application tests, global and feature coverage, lint, TypeScript, and static database validation for the combined branch; final build and dependency audit are recorded in the verification table after completion.
- Confirmed PR #43 passed clean migration replay and the full pgTAP suite, squash-merged it as `c75f6f1`, synchronized `main`, and created `feat/nak-68-broker-representative-verification` from that exact checkpoint.
- Generalized the existing private identity subject, attempt, management-token, and worker-lease model for an organization representative while retaining candidate compatibility and enforcing cross-table subject binding.
- Kept the raw representative birth date out of the database RPC and retained only a purpose-bound HMAC during processing; terminal decisions and consent withdrawal erase it, and a missing worker key defers rather than misclassifies a decision.
- Added the exact AAL2 verification command, no-store API, independent rate limit, onboarding actions, generic management-link recovery, representative-name invalidation, and shared Didit worker processing without enabling business documents or workspace activation.
- Added 39 representative-verification pgTAP assertions plus application coverage for origin/session/rate-limit/proof/input isolation, provider recovery, worker matching, privacy, and UI behavior. Static database validation passes; clean pgTAP replay remains deferred to PR CI because Docker/Podman is unavailable locally.
- Passed lint, TypeScript, the production build, the zero-vulnerability dependency audit, all 535 application tests, and the per-feature coverage policy. The full test runner required controlled concurrency on this Windows host; the timed-out parallel suites passed independently and the controlled full run passed completely.
- Committed representative verification locally as `e85bd19` and created stacked branch `feat/nak-68-brokerdesk-customer-intake` without pushing or opening a PR, preserving the user's combined-checkpoint workflow.
- Implemented the safe manual customer intake vertical slice: private hashed invitations, fragment-to-HttpOnly exchange, verified-email claim, explicit versioned consent, delayed canonical-portfolio activation, one-year mandate, broker-only projection, and customer-only multi-broker projection.
- Tightened the capability foundation from capability-scoped direct relationship reads to projection-only access by revoking authenticated `SELECT` on `broker_clients`; updated the earlier pgTAP contracts accordingly.
- Added the operational customers, customer invitation, and My Brokers interfaces plus five active versioned API contracts and independent rate-limit buckets. Spreadsheet content storage remains deliberately unavailable.
- Passed all 556 application tests, global and per-feature coverage gates, TypeScript, production build, static database validation, and a zero-vulnerability dependency audit. Local clean migration/pgTAP replay remains unavailable without Docker/Podman and is mandatory before merge.
- Added the opaque customer relationship detail API and page with database-resolved workspace/relationship authorization, current team assignment, mandate-aware actions, and uniform unavailable responses.
- Corrected the broker customer list and detail privacy boundary so mutable candidate/draft fields are never projected; only the last customer-published snapshot is visible, with a neutral pre-publication placeholder.
- Passed lint, TypeScript, all 559 application tests, global and per-feature coverage, production build, static database validation, and a zero-vulnerability dependency audit. The combined clean migration and 44-assertion customer-intake/detail pgTAP suite remains mandatory in PR CI.
- PR #44 clean replay exposed PostgreSQL's prohibition on renaming an existing function input through `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`. Preserved the legacy `p_candidate_id` argument name for migration compatibility while documenting that its value now identifies the normalized candidate-or-representative verification subject.
- After the function-signature correction, clean replay completed and pgTAP exposed two legacy relationship fixtures that omitted the now-required `starts_at` value. Updated every successful direct broker-relationship fixture to satisfy the current term invariant; the authenticated denial fixture remains intentionally unauthorized.
- The subsequent pgTAP run reached the new customer projection and exposed a PL/pgSQL variable/column ambiguity for `organization_id`. Renamed the routine-local value to `v_organization_id` throughout the projection without changing authorization semantics.
- The privacy regression fixture then reached the existing first-publication gate and was correctly rejected because it lacked verified candidate identity. Updated only the fixture to establish a current verified subject before publishing; the production verification gate remains unchanged.
- The same publication fixture then reached the protected-primary-photo gate and was correctly rejected. Added one `interest_required` hero-media fixture with a blurred derivative, matching the existing safe publication contract without relaxing production media checks.
- All 43 customer-intake/detail assertions then passed, exposing a stale `plan(44)` declaration. Corrected it to 43. The new repository-wide `db:smoke` plan-count guard also found and corrected the representative-verification test's stale 39-test plan (41 assertions), preventing both mismatches from reaching CI again.
- The expanded CI log also showed the representative-verification fixture stopping when joined verification and organization rows both exposed `status`. Qualified all verification-status reads with the existing table alias; this is a fixture-query correction and does not alter production authorization behavior.
