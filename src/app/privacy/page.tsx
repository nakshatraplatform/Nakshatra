        <p>Depending on what you choose to complete, VivIntro may store identity and contact details, education and work information, family background, lifestyle and partner preferences, astrology details, photos, and an optional horoscope document.</p>

      <PolicySection title="Public, approved, and private information">
        <p>Your draft is private until you publish. A public introduction can be opened by anyone who receives its link, and recipients may forward that link.</p>
        <p>Exact birth details, direct contact information, income, and original horoscope documents are kept outside the public introduction. Light or Dark changes appearance; Balanced or Private changes how much the public introduction reveals.</p>

      <PolicySection title="Storage and service providers">
        <p>VivIntro uses contracted infrastructure providers for authentication, database storage, private file storage, and delivery of account emails. These providers process information only to operate the service.</p>
        <p>Public pages are marked not to be indexed by search engines, but this cannot prevent a person who has the link from saving or forwarding what they can view.</p>

      <PolicySection title="Your choices and requests">
        <p>You can edit a draft, change appearance and privacy mode, unpublish a biodata, replace its public link, or allow the link to expire. Public links currently expire after 30 days unless renewed.</p>
